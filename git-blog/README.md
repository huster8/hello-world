# Portfolio Page to Upload Coding Projects

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] for learning purposes. I wanted to practice creating components 

## Task Lists

- [x] Add an option to upload images for new coding projects
**Note: only allows preview of image, does not store to database as no such database exists yet.**
- [ ] Create an assets folder with previews, use a hook to dynamically load images based on projects data 
- [x] Add a drop-down option to preview projects using images
- [ ] Add login option to ensure only an admin can add/remove new projects
- [ ] Use Tailwind for learning purposes to make a more aesthetic look 
- [ ] Move database to back-end server for practice purposes
